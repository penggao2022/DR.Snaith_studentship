# DR.Snaith_studentship
The coding task for a studentship of RGU

I have finished Dr.Snaith coding task for the transcirpts. Using spacy library and load en_core_web_sm model. For this task, I run the main.py file under windows system.
Firstly, dowanload the main file main.py and transcript.txt to your own computer.(My python version is 3.9.2)
Secondly, typing two commands to import essential libraries. $ pip install spacy
                                                             $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Thirdly, put the main.py file and transcript.txt file to one folder. Run the main.py file, the result will be shown in clean_data.txt file(which I named)

About the processing and limit of this work
The processing, I just use spacy library and model to extract the name entities and analyze them. To establish the connections bewteen name and their arrribute. About the limitation about this task, I think there are many limitation. Firstly, the data is insufficient so that I do not know how to use deep learning model to finish these task, If there are more data, I think I can compile a deep learning model to finish these task to make this task more robust
